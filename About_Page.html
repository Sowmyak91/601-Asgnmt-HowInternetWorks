  <h3 class="display-6">We all use Internet, but how much do we know about who invented and how it works? Well here it is, browse through this site to know about how internet works!</h3>
  <p class="lead">Internet is made of an incredibly large number of independently operated networks what's interesting about the system is that
      it's fully distributed there's no central control that's deciding how packets are routed or where pieces are
      networked or build or even who interconnects with whom these are all business decisions that are made
      independently by the operators they are all motivated to assure that there is end-to-end connectivity of every part of
      the network because the utility in the net is that any device can communicate
      with any other device.</p>
