                <p class="card-text">A <b>domain name</b> is an identification string that defines a realm of
                    administrative autonomy,
                    authority or control within the Internet. Domain names are used in various networking contexts and
                    for
                    application-specific
                    naming and addressing purposes. In general, a domain name identifies a network domain,
                    or it represents an Internet Protocol (IP) resource, such as a personal computer used to access the
                    Internet,
                    a server computer hosting a website, or the web site itself or any other service communicated via
                    the Internet.
                    <br> Domain names are formed by the rules and procedures of the Domain Name System (DNS).
                    Any name registered in the DNS is a domain name. Domain names are organized in subordinate levels
                    (subdomains)
                    of the DNS root domain, which is nameless.
                    The first-level set of domain names are the top-level domains (TLDs), including the generic
                    top-level domains
                    (gTLDs), such as the prominent domains com, info, net, edu, and org, and the country code top-level
                    domains
                    (ccTLDs).
                    <br>Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services,
                    with a text-based label that is easier to memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet
                    protocols.
                    A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances. Individual
                    Internet host computers use domain names as host identifiers, also called hostnames.
                    The term hostname is also used for the leaf labels in the domain name system, usually without
                    further subordinate domain name space.
                    Hostnames appear as a component in Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) for Internet resources such as
                    websites (e.g., en.wikipedia.org)</p>

            <div class="card-body">
                <p class="card-text">The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers<b>(ICANN)</b> is an
                    American multi-stakeholder group and nonprofit organization
                    responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the
                    namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet,
                    ensuring the network's stable and secure operation. <br>
                    ICANN performs the actual technical maintenance work of the Central Internet Address pools and DNS
                    root zone registries pursuant to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) function contract.
                    Much of its work has concerned the Internet's global Domain Name System (DNS), including policy
                    development for internationalization of the DNS system, introduction of new generic top-level
                    domains (TLDs),
                    and the operation of root name servers. The numbering facilities ICANN manages include the Internet
                    Protocol address spaces for IPv4 and IPv6, and assignment of address blocks to regional Internet
                    registries.
                    ICANN also maintains registries of Internet Protocol identifiers. <br>
                    ICANN's primary principles of operation have been described as helping preserve the operational
                    stability of the Internet;
                    to promote competition; to achieve broad representation of the global Internet community; and to
                    develop policies appropriate to its mission through bottom-up,
                    consensus-based processes.
