          <ul>
               <li class="lead">Every URL link that begins with HTTP uses a basic type of “hypertext transfer protocol”.
                   Created by Tim Berners-Lee back in the early 1990’s. </li>
              <li class="lead"> when the Internet was still in its infancy,
                   this network protocol standard is what allows web browsers and servers to communicate through the exchange of data.</li>
               <li class="lead">HTTP is also called “a stateless system”, which means that it enables connection on demand.
                   You click on a link, requesting a connection, and your web browser sends this request to the server, which responds by opening the page.
                   The quicker the connection is, the faster the data is presented to you.</li>
               <li class="lead">As an “application layer protocol”, HTTP remains focused on presenting the information,
                   but cares less about the way this information travels from one place to another.</li>
               <li class="lead">Unfortunately, this means that HTTP can be intercepted and potentially altered,
                   making both the information and the information receiver vulnerable.</li>

             </ul>
      </div>
    <div class="col-6"><h3 class="lead text-center"><b>HTTPS : Encrypted Connections</b></h3><br>
        <ul>
               <li class="lead">HTTPS is not the opposite of HTTP, but its younger cousin.</li>
               <li class="lead"> The two are essentially the same, in that both of them refer to the same “hypertext transfer protocol”
                   that enables requested web data to be presented on your screen.
                   But, HTTPS is still slightly different, more advanced, and much more secure.</li>
               <li class="lead">HTTPS helps ensure cyber-safety. It is, without any doubt, a better network protocol solution than its older cousin, HTTP.</li>
               <li class="lead">Simply put, HTTPS protocol is an extension of HTTP.
                   That “S” in the abbreviation comes from the word Secure and it is powered by Transport Layer Security (TLS) [the successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)],
                   the standard security technology that establishes an encrypted connection between a web server and a browser.</li>
               <li class="lead">Without HTTPS, any data you enter into the site (such as your username/password, credit card or bank details,
                   any other form submission data, etc.) will be sent plaintext and therefore susceptible to interception or eavesdropping.
                   For this reason, you should always check that a site is using HTTPS before you enter any information.</li>
               <li class="lead">In addition to encrypting the data transmitted between the server and your browser,
                   TLS also authenticates the server you are connecting to and protects that transmitted data from tampering.</li>
